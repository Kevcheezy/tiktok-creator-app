# Product Roadmap: 3-Layer AI UGC System

Based on Adrian Solar's framework ("The 3 Layers Behind Highly Profitable AI UGC — $800k+ Generated").

## The Framework

| Layer | What | Current Grade |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **L1: Concept** | Persona, pain points, unique mechanism, transformation | **D** — skipped entirely |
| **L2: Execution** | Script, casting, video, voiceover, editing | **B** — solid but single-variant |
| **L3: Optimization** | Structured testing, performance tracking, pattern recognition | **F** — missing |

## Phase A: Concept Foundation (Backlog)
- Concept Builder — guided persona/pain/mechanism/transformation wizard
- Concept-Driven Scripts — ScriptingAgent uses full concept context
- Concept alignment scoring in Script Review

## Phase B: Variation Engine (Backlog)
- Multi-Actor Testing — same script, 3-5 influencers
- Multi-Script Variation — same actor, 3-5 scripts
- Hook A/B Testing — same everything, different openings
- Side-by-side comparison UI

## Phase C: Optimization Loop (Backlog)
- Creative Testing Framework — structured test tracking
- Performance Data Import — TikTok/Meta ad metrics
- Pattern Dashboard — surface winning patterns

## Phase D: Advanced (Future)
- Concept Mining from Reviews
- Speech-to-Speech (replace TTS)
- Concept Validation via Static Ads
- Pattern Recognition Engine
- Automated Remix & Iteration

## Current Priority

**E2E Pipeline MVP** — complete the working pipeline from product URL to finished 60-second video before adding strategic layers. The 3-layer features build on top of a working execution pipeline.
